# School District Analysis of Public and Charter Schools

I started my analysis by importing and inspecting the data into Jupyter Notebook. I then checked the data for missing values, as well as duplicate rows, and removed them. I summarized the data and found the average scores for each grade. I drilled down into the data to find specific parameters that were requested and finished the analysis by making resquested comparisons of the data.
